springmvc-mysql-blog
====================

This is a sample blog project which uses Spring MVC 3 framework and MySQL for persistance. 

First Create a MySQL database named "Blog" and run the project.properties/blog.sql script. That should set up the database.

On resource/jdbc.properties file, write up the jdbc.username and jdbc.password. That should be username and password for your MySQL database.

That project was written using STS Spring MVC Template project. That project is build with Maven 3. So importing project in STS/Eclipse should be easy.
